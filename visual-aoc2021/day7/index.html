                <p>The task is to align a swarm of crabs to a common horizontal position, 
                    while spending as little fuel as possible. Read the full description of the puzzle at <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/7">Advent of Code</a></p>
                <p>
                    Each pink dot in the visualisation represents a crab. To find the optimal 
                    position for the swarm, we calculate the median of all crabs position, visualised by the vertical line. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The cost for every crab to move to that position is the difference between the crabs 
                    current position and the median position.
